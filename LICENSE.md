    Dataset or modifications of the Dataset (your "Modified Set") only
    if you adhere to the following requirements:

    3.1. You do not explicitly or implicitly represent that that your
        Modified Set is the Dataset itself. One way to satisfy this
        requirement is, in connection with such redistribution, to

        modification of the Dataset and to provide the attribution in
        Item 4 below.

        Modified Set except for non-commercial research purposes.

    3.3. If you allow others to redistribute or make available the

        must require them to:

    - do so only for non-commercial research purposes;

    - restrict their recipients to non-commercial research purposes
    through terms at least as restrictive as provided in these Items 3.2 and
    3.3;

    - include terms at least as protective of Autodesk as provided in
    Items 6 and 7; and

    - retain any notices or attributions associated with the Dataset that
    were provided by you (and to impose this requirement on any downstream
    recipients, if any).

4.  At your discretion as subject to general principles of academic
    attribution, if your use of the Dataset was a substantial
    contributor to your research, provide attribution to the "Fusion 360
    Gallery Dataset" and the relevant citations provided on the Dataset
    website.

5.  This License does not grant you permission to use any Autodesk trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names, except as

    of the Dataset and satisfying the request for attribution in Item 4
    above.

    Dataset, including but not limited to warranties of
    non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular
    purpose.
